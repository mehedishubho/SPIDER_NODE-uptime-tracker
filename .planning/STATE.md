# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-08)

**Core value:** Modernize the infrastructure without breaking existing monitoring — never lose or corrupt uptime data, silently stop checking, or lock users out irrecoverably.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Design Gate (Review Verdict READY)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Design Gate — Review Verdict READY)
Plan: 0 of 0 in current phase (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-08 — Roadmap created (94/94 requirements mapped across 8 phases)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: audit §24 order chosen, compressed to 8 phases at standard granularity (design gate first; dark launch split from overlap cutover)
- WRK-09/WRK-11 placed in Phase 5 — heartbeat parity and overlap gates are only verifiable once the worker scheduler unpauses
- EML-04 placed in Phase 7 — Better Auth hooks cannot delegate to the email queue before Better Auth exists (Phase 6 builds the queue)
- DAT-11 (windowed-uptime backend) placed in Phase 8 — flagged feature work kept out of the highest-risk migration phase
- OBS-04/SEC-04 placed in Phase 7 — Bull Board admin gating requires the Better Auth admin plugin

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags requiring `--research-phase` during planning: Phase 4 (BullMQ 6 `upsertJobScheduler`, breaker/backlog tuning, PM2 handshake), Phase 7 (social `providerId` casing, token-flow cutover, cookieCache revocation lag), Phase 3 (drizzle-kit journal-stamping, `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` transaction wrapping)
- Live production system: every cutover step needs a full `pg_dump` backup and an anonymized-snapshot rehearsal first (D-9/D-10)
